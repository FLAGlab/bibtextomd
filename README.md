BibTeX to markdown formatter
---

This python script takes a BibTeX bibliography file and converts the 
entries to the format used by my website, [bryanwweber.com](http://bryanwweber.com).
The BibTeX file for testing was generated by export from Mendeley, 
although Mendeley is fairly standards conforming, so most standard
BibTeX files should work as well.

Usage
---

From the command line,

    python bib.py [options]

runs the script. The default file names for the BibTeX input and 
markdown output are `refs.bib` and `pubs.md` respectively. 

Options
---

    -h, --help: Print the help and exit
    -o filename, --output=filename: Set the filename of the markdown output
    -b filename, --bibfile=filename: Set the filename of the BibTeX input
